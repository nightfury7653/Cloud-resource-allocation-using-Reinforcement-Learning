# 📝 Note on Documentation

**For Future Phases:**

Starting from Phase 4 onwards, documentation files (.md) will **only be created if explicitly requested**.

This keeps the repository clean and focused on code rather than excessive documentation.

**Current Session (Oct 31, 2025):**
- ✅ All documentation organized into `docs/` structure
- ✅ Planning, phases, algorithms, issues, sessions categorized
- ✅ README updated with docs/ reference

**Going Forward:**
- Code changes will be documented in git commits
- Major milestones can request summary docs if needed
- Focus on clean, working code over documentation

---

*This policy was set on October 31, 2025, after organizing all documentation from Phases 1-3.*
